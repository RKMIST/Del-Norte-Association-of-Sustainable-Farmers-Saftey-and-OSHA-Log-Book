### Peoples feedback/notes
- Pressing buttons should have an indicator, many people kept pressing the corn button thinking that it was not selected.
- The game UI could be improved, it currently looks very bland and we need more bright colors.
- Add money to the game so that you can't plant unlimited corn.
- Add some variety to the game so that it is not all just corn.
